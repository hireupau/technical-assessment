# Technical Assessment

## Overview

We'd like you to build a calculator that determines the cost of Hireup
bookings. A booking is the time worked by a support worker with a user.

Your application should read a collection of bookings from a provided JSON
file, calculate the cost of each booking and write the result to a new file.

We have given you a starting point in the files [calculator.js](./calculator.js) and [calculator.test.js](./calculator.test.js) but you are welcome to come up with what ever solution you see fit.

## Prerequisites

- npm 8
- node 16

## Setup

1. Install package dependencies with this command `$ npm install`
2. Run unit test with this command `$ npm test`
3. Run the program with this command `$ npm start`

## Input

We've included a file called input.json that contains a collection of
bookings. Each booking has an id, a from datetime and to datetime:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "from": "2017-10-23T08:00:00+11:00",
    "to": "2017-10-23T11:00:00+11:00"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "from": "2017-10-20T09:00:00+11:00",
    "to": "2017-10-20T11:45:00+11:00"
  }
]
```

## Business rules

### Hourly rates

The rules to calculate the hourly rate of a booking are summarised below:

| Rate Type | From | To | Rate ($) |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Day  | 0600 | 2000 | 38
| Night | 2000 | 0600 | 42.93
| Sat | All day | All day | 45.91
| Sun | All day | All day | 60.85

### Rules
- The minimum booking time is 1 hour
- The maximum booking time is 24 hours
- A booking cannot end before it has started
- A booking can be booked in 15 min increments e.g. 1600 to 1715
- If any part of a booking is charged at the night rate, the whole booking is
  charged at the night rate:
  * Fri 1800 - 2100 will be charged at the night rate (3 x 42.93)
  * Wed 0500 - 1000 will be charged at the night rate (5 x 42.93)
- Saturday and Sunday rates apply across the whole day, there's no distinction
  between day and night:
  * Sat 1800 - 2200 will be charged at the sat rate (4 x 45.91)
  * Sun 0100 - 0700 will be charged at the sun rate (6 x 60.85)

## Output

Your application should create a file called output.json containing the array
of booking objects with total and isValid properties added. If the booking
breaks one of the business rules, the total should be set to 0 and the isValid
flag marked false.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "from": "2017-10-23T08:00:00+11:00",
    "to": "2017-10-23T11:00:00+11:00",
    "isValid": true,
    "total": 114
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "from": "2017-10-20T09:00:00+11:00",
    "to": "2017-10-20T11:45:00+11:00" ,
    "isValid": true,
    "total": 104.50
  },
]
```

You can see the expected output can be found in
[expectedOutput.json](./expectedOutput.json)
